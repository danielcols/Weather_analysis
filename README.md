# weather_data_analysis

## Purpose:

Utilizing a preexisting database encompassing years of daily temperature readings, the aim is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of weather patterns. Additionally, an API has been developed to facilitate data access for external users.

## Tools:

The interaction with the SQLite database embedded within the Jupyter Notebook was facilitated through the SQLAlchemy package. Data analysis was conducted employing tools such as Pandas, NumPy, and the DateTime package. The creation of the API was achieved utilizing Python's Flask package.

## Results:

The Jupyter Notebook presents initial data analysis with visual representations of precipitation and temperature data. The weatherapp.py script encompasses the API code for activation. The API offers users access to various routes, including precipitation, station, and temperature data. Furthermore, interactive routes enable data filtering based on user-input dates.
